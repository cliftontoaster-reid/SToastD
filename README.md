# School 42, SToastD

## Definitions

### Module

A module is a collection of c files or other modules, grouping similar functions, a good example is the `io` module, which contains functions for input and output management.

## Description

SToastD is my implementation of a C standard library, that I will be using in my project from the School 42 curriculum. 
For now the only modules implemented or in current development are:
- `io`: input and output management
    - `fs`: file system management
    - `stdio`: standard input and output management
- `alloc`: memory management
    - `string`: string management
